<p style="font-size:30px;">As per our previous experience, we saw that after every exam the students discussed about their marks and were very tense. So, we thought that it would be best if we could help them predict their results in advance so that they may improve upon depending on their current performance.  </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:30px;">This project is all about making a students result prediction systematic and finding relative grading. Our prediction algorithm which we have used is a self-made algorithm. We are going to get the marks on the students of a batch for CATs and FATs.</p>
